  "Specify Boot's classpath in a file instead of as Maven coordinates.

  The --file option is required -- this specifies the PATH of the file that
  will contain the JAR paths as a string suitable for passing to java -cp.

  The default behavior if the --write flag is not specified is to read the
  file specified with --file and load all the JARs onto the classpath. If the
  --write flag is given the --dependencies (or the default depenedncies from
  the boot env, e.g. (get-env :dependencies), if --dependencies isn't provided)
  are resolved and the resulting list of JAR paths are written to the file in
  a format suitable for passing to java -cp.

  The --pedantic flag configures the task to throw an exception when writing
  the classpath file if there are any unresolved dependency conflicts. These
  conflicts can be resolved by adding :exclusions and by overriding transitive
  dependencies with direct dependencies.

  The --libdir option specifies the PATH where the dependency JARs should be
  stashed. The default if this option is not given is to use the Maven local
  repository setting from the boot environment. This option only applies in
  combination with the --out option.

  The --scopes option can be used to specify which dependency scopes to include
  in the classpath file. The default scopes are compile, runtime, and provided."
